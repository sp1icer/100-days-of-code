# 100 Days Of Code - 2020

### Day 1: October 12, 2020 (1/100)

**Today's Progress**: Did all of Basic HTML and Basic CSS on freeCodeCamp. Had a few project ideas that I generated.

**Thoughts:**: So far, I'm really liking the way that FCC is set up. It makes it super easy to learn and progress. Lots of progress, since I've had some exposure to HTML/CSS from before.

**Link to work:**: N/A...yet.

### Day 2: October 13, 2020 (2/100)

**Today's Progress**: Did all of Applied Visual Design and Applied Accsesibility on freeCodeCamp. No net new stuff today, but standing desk pieces are slowly coming in >:D

**Thoughts:**: I wasn't as big of a fan of these 2 sections for how FCC is set up - I'd rather see them in action in a project. I still think FCC is super dope, just wish it was more like doing a project ground-up rather than one-off lessons.

**Link to work:**: N/A...yet.

### Day 3: October 14, 2020 (2/100)

**Today's Progress**: Missed out on doing 100 days of code today - spent the entire night assembling the standing desk!

**Thoughts:**: N/A

**Link to work:**: N/A...yet.

### Day 4: October 15, 2020 (3/100)

**Today's Progress**: I finished the responsive web design section! Now all that's left is doing the projects section. This is going to be the fun part :)

**Thoughts:**: I'm super excited to get into the actual projects portion - first stop is the tribute page!

**Link to work:**: N/A...yet.

### Day 5: October 16, 2020 (4/100)

**Today's Progress**: I didn't get a chance to do the full hour tonight, but 30 mins > no coding, so I'll take it. I started on the Tribute page, doing an ode to Cereal Killah :) worked on wireframing mostly, with small amounts of hangups on grid-area and typos causing me to lose a lot of time.

**Thoughts:**: I'm frustrated about the lack of progress - two typos kept me still for way too long. I couldn't focus at all tonight.

### Day 6: October 17, 2020 (5/100)

**Today's Progress**: Managed to nail down and get a few of the user stories done. Added cereal killer image, worked on css for header and footer, nailed down grid (I think).

**Thoughts:**: Frustrated at slow progress, but it's still good to see some progress. Partly just want to get it finished so I can keep moving!
