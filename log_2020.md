# 100 Days Of Code - 2020

### Day 1: October 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did all of Basic HTML and Basic CSS on freeCodeCamp. Had a few project ideas that I generated.

**Thoughts:**: So far, I'm really liking the way that FCC is set up. It makes it super easy to learn and progress. Lots of progress, since I've had some exposure to HTML/CSS from before.

**Link to work:**: N/A...yet.

### Day 2: October 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did all of Applied Visual Design and Applied Accsesibility on freeCodeCamp. No net new stuff today, but standing desk pieces are slowly coming in >:D

**Thoughts:**: I wasn't as big of a fan of these 2 sections for how FCC is set up - I'd rather see them in action in a project. I still think FCC is super dope, just wish it was more like doing a project ground-up rather than one-off lessons.

**Link to work:**: N/A...yet.

### Day 4: October 15, 2020
