# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge!

Hi everyone! I'm sp1icer, and normally I'm a penetration tester and information security addict. I'm joining in on the #100daysofcode challenge in order to beef up my programming game, since I mostly ignored it for a large portion of my studies :P Here's my hope for the 100 days of code:
* Become decent in C
* Become proficient in Python
* Learn front-end development
* Learn some Computer Science  

I'll be tracking my progress in 2 places: [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/sp1icer) and [in the Log for this year](log_2020.md). I'm also going to link to the projects as I make it to them, so keep an eye out for those to pop into the logs. :) Hope to see you around!
