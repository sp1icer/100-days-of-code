# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge - Oct 2020

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
Oct 12, 2020

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the (Log)[log_2020.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will write a blog post at the end that breaks down my experience, both the pros and the cons!
